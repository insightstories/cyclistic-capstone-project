# Cyclistic Capstone Project 🚲

It is also my very first GitHub repository as I finish the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and start creating and growing my portfolio.

If you flip through this report, you might get a strong whiff of a biology research paper style. That is because I've spent most of my professional life studying, teaching, researching, or working in biology. You may take the man out of biology, but it seems like it takes more work to take biology out of his writing.

Anyhow,
