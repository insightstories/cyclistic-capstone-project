# 📊 Cyclistic Capstone Project 🚲

## Project Overview
This capstone project, which is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, aims to analyze historical data of Cyclistic, a ride-share company, to understand the differences between how casual riders and annual members use these services differently. The results of the analysis are then to be used to drive the marketing strategies for converting casual riders into annual members.

This work also happens to be my very first comprehensive data analytics project and GitHub repository.

## Business Question
How do casual riders and members differ in their usage of Cyclistic bike-share services?

## Insights Summary
- Members take more rides per month and year, but the average ride duration and maximum ride duration of casual members are longer.
- Both casual riders and members prefer classic bikes over electric bikes, especially in warmer months of the year.
- Casual riders tend to ride around the touristic areas and lakefront, while members routes are concentrated in the business district and at transit hubs.
