# Cyclistic Capstone Project 🚲
This project analyzes historical bike-share data to understand differences between casual riders and members to drive the marketing campaign that aims to convert casual riders into members.  It is also my very first GitHub repository as I finish the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and start creating and growing my portfolio.
